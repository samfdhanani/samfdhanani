# Hello!

My name is Sam Dhanani, and I am a research assistant at the Muhle Lab at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. 
My work primarily involves the analysis of behavioral and neurophysiological data, utilizing custom-made Python scripts to process and interpret complex datasets.
I focus on data generated from Med Associates operant boxes and the Neurophotometrics FP 3002 recording system.
- **Med Associates Operant Boxes:** I have employed Python to complete and analyze the following behavioral assays:
  - Sustained Attention Task
  - Differential Reinforcement of Low Rate (DRL)
  - Differential Reinforcement of High Rate (DRH)
- **Neurophotometrics FP 3002 Recording System:** I have developed a Python script to analyze an assay that examines the physiological response to an injection. This script enables the extrapolation of a recorded baseline period to the post-injection recording, providing insights into the neural activity changes induced by the injection.
