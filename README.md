# Hello!

My name is Sam Dhanani, and I am a research assistant at the Muhle Lab at the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI). My work primarily involves the analysis of behavioral and neurophysiological data, utilizing custom-made Python scripts to process and interpret complex datasets. I focus on data generated from Med Associates operant boxes (owned by the Balsam-Simpson Lab at NYSPI, a massive thank you to their team for teaching me how to use the boxes and allowing me to use them!) and the [Neurophotometrics](https://neurophotometrics.com/) FP3002 recording system.
- **Med Associates Operant Boxes:** I have employed Python to complete and analyze the following behavioral assays:
  - Sustained Attention Task
  - Progressive Ratio
  - Differential Reinforcement of Low Rate (DRL)
  - Differential Reinforcement of High Rate (DRH)
- **Neurophotometrics FP3002:** I have developed a Python script to analyze an assay that examines the physiological response to an injection. This script enables the extrapolation of a recorded baseline period to the post-injection recording, providing insights into the neural activity changes induced by the injection.
